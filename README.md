# sign-up-form

The odin project assignment to make a sign-up form - Intermediate HTML and CSS

The two images used belong to/made by my girlfriend - Amy Lightowlers. 

The main photo she took when we went on holiday to Croatia. It was taken on the island of Mljet next to the cave of Odysseus.

And the second image used for the logo is a painting she did of an octopus portraying me. This is an image I use often. This time though I used a photo editor to remove the background and half of the octopus to give a vague look of the octopus half out of the water.

I did also use the whole octopus paining on the second page when you click on the "click here" link.
